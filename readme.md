Deny Facebook
=============

Some juice for your hosts file

- Speed up your browsing experience
- Don't be tracked by FB
- Enjoy the internet again!

If you are sick of slow page loads and a compromised web browsing experience (all the like buttons and widgets are shit right?) being forced upon you without you asking, just add this to your hosts file and forget about it. 

Life is much better now.
